# Idempotently ensures a Hetzner Cloud firewall with the given name exists,
# creating it from the given rules file only if it's missing. Plain
# `hcloud firewall create` errors if the name is already taken (e.g. it
# survived a server teardown, or a previous run of this same setup), so this
# checks first via `hcloud firewall describe` instead of assuming a clean
# project.
#
# Does NOT update rules on an already-existing firewall — if you've changed
# the rules file and need them applied to a firewall that already exists, use
# `hcloud firewall replace-rules` by hand.
