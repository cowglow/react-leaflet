# WebStorm Postgres connection

WebStorm's built-in Database tool (same engine as DataGrip) can connect straight to
the local Postgres container started by `pnpm backend:up` / `pnpm dev:all`, so you can
browse and query `Account` / `Member` / `Organization` / `AuditLogEntry` without going
through Adminer or `psql`.

## Local (dev) database

### Prerequisites

The `db` container must be running — `docker-compose.yml` maps it to `5432:5432` on
the host, so this works the same whether you started the stack with `pnpm backend:up`
or `pnpm dev:all`:

```bash
pnpm backend:up   # or pnpm dev:all
```

### Connection values

Defaults come from `docker-compose.yml`'s `${VAR:-default}` fallbacks; if you copied
`.env.example` to `.env` at the repo root without changing anything, these are exactly
what's in there:

| Field    | Value                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Host     | `localhost`                                     |
| Port     | `5432`                                          |
| Database | `contact_book`                                  |
| User     | `app`                                           |
| Password | `app`                                           |
| URL      | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/contact_book` |

If your `.env` overrides `POSTGRES_USER`/`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`/`POSTGRES_DB`, use those
values instead — they're what's actually inside the running container, not the
defaults above.

### Steps

1. Open the **Database** tool window (`View → Tool Windows → Database`, or search
   "Database" in Help → Find Action).
2. Click **+** → **Data Source** → **PostgreSQL**.
3. Fill in Host/Port/Database/User/Password from the table above.
4. On first connection WebStorm will prompt to download the PostgreSQL JDBC driver —
   accept it (**Download driver files**).
5. Click **Test Connection** — should show a green check. If it fails, confirm the
   container is actually up: `docker compose ps db` should show `healthy`.
6. Click **OK**. The `contact_book` database now appears in the tool window, with
   `Account`, `Member`, `Organization`, `MagicLinkToken`, and `AuditLogEntry` tables
   under the `public` schema (from `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`).

### Notes

This connects directly to Postgres, bypassing Prisma and the API entirely — fine for
inspecting data, but don't hand-edit rows you expect the app (or the audit log hash
chain in `backend/src/infrastructure/prisma/audit-log.ts`) to stay consistent with.

## Production database (via SSH tunnel)

`docker-compose.prod.yml`'s `db` service has **no `ports:` mapping at all** — Postgres
is reachable only from inside the server's Docker network, not from the host, let
alone the public internet. That's deliberate (see `docs/HETZNER_DEPLOY.md`), so
reaching it from WebStorm means tunneling through SSH access to the same `deploy`
account used for deployment, to the container's internal IP rather than `localhost`.

The box has two keys authorized for `deploy`: `github-actions-deploy` (passphrase-free,
used only by CI — see `docs/HETZNER_DEPLOY.md`) and a personal `id_hetzner_admin` key
for manual access like this. Use the admin key below, not the CI one:

```bash
export HETZNER_KEY=cert/id_hetzner_admin
```

Treat this as read-only, debugging-only access. Prefer the app/API for anything that
should show up correctly — any row you edit or insert directly bypasses the
hash-chained audit log in `backend/src/infrastructure/prisma/audit-log.ts` entirely, silently breaking
the guarantee that every write is logged.

### 1. Find the container's internal IP

```bash
ssh -i $HETZNER_KEY deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP \
  "docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' visual-directory-db"
```

### 2. Open an SSH tunnel to it

Forward a local port to `<container_ip>:5432` (not `localhost:5432` on the
server — nothing is listening there). Pick a local port other than `5432` if your
local dev Postgres (above) is also running, e.g. `55432`:

```bash
ssh -i $HETZNER_KEY -L 55432:<container_ip>:5432 deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

Leave this running for the duration of your session; `Ctrl+C` closes the tunnel.

### 3. Get the real credentials

These exist only in GitHub Secrets and the server's `/opt/visual-directory/.env` —
never in git, and `gh secret` can't read secret values back once set:

```bash
ssh -i $HETZNER_KEY deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP "cat /opt/visual-directory/.env"
```

Read off `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB`.

### 4. Add the Data Source in WebStorm

Same as the [local steps](#steps) above, but:

- Host: `localhost`
- Port: whatever you forwarded in step 2 (e.g. `55432`)
- Database/User/Password: from step 3
- Name it clearly, e.g. **"contact_book (PRODUCTION)"** — it'll otherwise look
  identical to the dev connection in the tool window, which is exactly how someone
  runs a dev-only query against real member data by mistake.

Close the SSH tunnel when you're done; don't leave production reachable from your
machine unattended.
